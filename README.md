# Symfony Payment Processing Application

This is a Symfony-based application that integrates with external payment processors like Shift4 and ACI for processing payments.

## Features

- Payment form for entering credit card details.
- Integration with Shift4 and ACI payment gateways.
- Transaction success and failure pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **PHP >= 8.0**
- **Composer** (dependency manager)
- **Symfony CLI** (optional, for easier server management)
- **Node.js & npm** (for managing front-end dependencies, if applicable)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. Set up the environment variables by copying the `.env` file:

    ```

   Then adjust the database and other configuration in the `.env` file (e.g., database connection, API keys).

4. Install front-end dependencies (if applicable):

    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

5. Run database migrations (if using a database):
